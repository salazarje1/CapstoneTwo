# Hiking Site 

## Tech Stack 
For this project I want to use React for the frontend and Node for the backend. I'll have a database for users on the site running 
Postgres. And a databases or my API for hiking trails using MongoDB. 

## Focus of the projects 
I would like to focus on the full-stack application. But the backend will have a lot more work I think. 

## Site
The site will be a website. But since I am building my own API I would like to develope a mobile app later and connect to the API.

## Users 
I think users of any age will be interested in my website because more and more people seem to be interested in hiking. This site will
help them find what they are looking for. 

## Data 
I would collect data through users. The first set of data will be populated by me and it would continue to grow with more people using the site. 

## Outline 
My database schema will be for users and will have basic information from them. I will need to secure the password they use to sign into the website. With
the API I will build myself I think I will run into many problems like authentication, who is allowed to do and see what. I will also need a way to rate limit 
the calls to the api. A map api from mapbox.
